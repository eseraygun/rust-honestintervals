#![deny(warnings)]

//! Honest Intervals is an interval arithmetic library with correct rounding.
//!
//! It implements elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) as well
//! as complicated mathematical functions such as logarithm and power over intervals and interval
//! sets. Bounds of the return values are always correctly rounded up or down to ensure that all
//! possible results are contained.
//!
//! In addition to the `Interval` and `IntervalSet` structs, the library also provides the `Mpfr`
//! struct that wraps the GNU MPFR library. The `Mpfr` struct is an ideal (and currently only)
//! bound type for intervals.
//!
//! Honest Intervals tries to be a pragmatic implementation of interval arithmetic rather than an
//! abstract basis for all possible implementations. Users do not have to implement any traits; they
//! can create a correctly rounding interval right away by calling `IntervalSet::<Mpfr>::new()`.
